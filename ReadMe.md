https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity
## Overview

In this project, you will build a CLI application that retrieves and displays the recent activity of a GitHub user directly in the terminal.
This project helps you practice working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a command-line interface.

## Requirements

The application should:

1. Run from the command line.
2. Accept a GitHub username as an argument.
3. Fetch the user's recent activity using the GitHub API.
4. Display the activity in a readable format in the terminal.
5. Handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid usernames, network issues, or API rate limits).
6. Be implemented without using external libraries or frameworks for fetching data.

## Usage

Run the program from the command line, providing a GitHub username as an argument:

```bash
github-activity <username>
